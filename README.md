## About me

Hello! 
My name is Ernest Łabiński and I am working as a Quality Controller in Pilkington company. After 6 month of learning manual and automated testing i want to do my first steps in the IT world and would love to join your team. I don't have commercial experience, but during my learnings I already had the opportunity to test a web application and report the bugs I found in Jira. I know quite a few tools and I have some tech skills which are nessesary to good testing. As for the theory, I know why to test at all, what is the purpose of testing and the principles of testing, what is the difference between functional and non-functional testing, white-box and black-box testing, what is regression testing and retesting.  I am precise and focused on details, determined and try to improve my knowledge every day. I really enjoy working with people and share experiences with them. I am contactable and positive about the world and people. I hope you will give me a chance and I will be able to present myself at an interview, then you will see if I fit into your team.
